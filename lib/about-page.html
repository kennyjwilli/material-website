                        Choosing favorites is nearly impossible! Everyone has this issue, me included. Working on the short film, The Forest, was a blast! We spent an entire day in the forest filming a short action film. I loved piecing the final version together and watching all of our hard work come together! Nearly all of the projects that I work on for iNVERSION are awesome! I recently got to travel to a mansion in Alamo that overlooks the entire tri-valley. This is by far the most beautiful estate I have ever seen let alone been privileged enough to film at!

                        I am a camper. Ever since I was a little toddler my family and I have gone on camping trips across the US! Every year we travel to Yosemite and get to visit one of the most breath taking, jaw dropping environments in the entire world! Other than camping I love to hang out with my friends and girlfriend! I have never been a big video game player so it would be a rare time if you caught be playing one of those. I also love to spend time learning about new things, mostly related to technology, computers, and programming.
