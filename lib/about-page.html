                        Choosing favorites is nearly impossible! Everyone has this issue, me included. Working on the short film, The Forest, was a blast! We spent an entire day in the forest filming a short action film. I loved piecing the final version together and watching all of our hard work come together! Nearly all of the projects that I work on for iNVERSION are awesome! I recently got to travel to a mansion in Alamo that overlooks the entire tri-valley. This is by far the most beautiful estate I have ever seen let alone been privileged enough to film at!
